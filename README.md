# Don-t-Explode

This is a bomb tossing game where you the player will take turns throwing a bomb back and forth with the computer. The bomb count will start 
at 15 on the first round. The player and computer will choose to decrease the count by 1 or 2 when they have the bomb. The one who has the bomb
and decreases the count to 0 or less loses, while the other player wins.




This game was created as an inspiration to a mini-game in Mario Party 5 called "Head Waiter." To show my appreciation for a game that had 
provided so much fun to me as a child, I decided to recreate a game similar to it.
